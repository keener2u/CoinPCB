# CoinPCB
Simple Coin Shaped ESP8266 Breakout Board
# V0.1 Errata

D1 LED is setup incorrectly on foot print d1 polorization is wrong
-the infrared transmitter footprint needs to be rotated so the emitter is pointing out on the next rev
D3 and D2 LED need to be run to ground instead of power
 
# Updates for Next Version
add a spot for a pwm to run a servo
break out the rest of GPIO lines onto the board
add a coincell holder with a power switch
